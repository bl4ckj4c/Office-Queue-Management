- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    5    |    -   |    23      |     13.5     |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
  - Average: 4 hours and 4 minutes
  - Standard deviation: 3 hours and 40 minutes
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table
  - 56 / 57 = 0.982

- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5 hours
  - Total hours spent: 30 minutes
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 5 hours
  - Total hours spent: 4 hours and 30 minutes
- Technical Debt management:

  - Total hours spent: -
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: -
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues: -
  - Hours spent on remediation: -
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): -
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ): -
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
